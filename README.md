# TO-Do-list

<!-- Features:

Adding tasks: Allow users to add tasks to their to-do list.
Viewing tasks: Display the list of tasks to the user.
Completing tasks: Allow users to mark tasks as completed.
Deleting tasks: Enable users to remove tasks from the list.
Optional features (for further practice):

Saving tasks: Implement functionality to save the to-do list to a file.
Loading tasks: Allow users to load a previously saved to-do list from a file.
Prioritizing tasks: Enable users to assign priorities to tasks (low, medium, high) and sort them accordingly.
Implementation Tips:

Use a list or an array to store the tasks.
Use functions or classes to organize your code.
Utilize control structures (loops and conditional statements) to handle user input and perform different actions based on their choices.
Consider using file handling operations (e.g., reading from/writing to a text file) if you decide to implement the optional saving/loading feature. -->
